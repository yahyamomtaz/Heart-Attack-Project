    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the world health organization, Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death globally. In 2019 alone, around 17.9 million people died from CVDs. Of these deaths, **85%** of them were due to heart diseases. There are many factors that play a role in increasing the risk of heart disease. Identifying these factors and their impact is paramount in the field of healthcare. Identifying patients who are at greater risk enables medical professionals to respond quickly and efficiently, saving more lives.\n",

    "### About the Dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Personal Key Indicators of Heart Disease](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kamilpytlak/personal-key-indicators-of-heart-disease) dataset contains 320K rows and 18 columns. It is a cleaned, smaller version of the [2020 annual CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) survey data of 400k adults](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_data.htm). For each patient (row), it contains the health status of that individual. The data was collected in the form of surveys conducted over the phone. Each year, the CDC calls around 400K U.S residents and asks them about their health status, with the vast majority of questions being yes or no questions. \n",
    "\n",
    "**We made the decision to manually clean and predict the missing values after downloading the original dataset.**\n",

    "### Missing Data Imputation\n",
    "\n",
    "Addressing missing data is a fundamental aspect of data preprocessing. When missing data was encountered, appropriate imputation techniques were applied, such as using the mean, median, or mode, to fill in missing values.\n",
    "These cleaning and preprocessing steps are essential to create a clean and consistent dataset that is suitable for building machine learning models. Detailed documentation of these steps is crucial for transparency, reproducibility, and collaboration in the data analysis process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Missing Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the field of data analysis and machine learning, missing data is a common challenge. Understanding the types of missing data is crucial for choosing the right imputation technique. There are three primary types of missing data:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Missing Completely at Random (MCAR):** In this type, the missing data points are randomly distributed throughout the dataset, and the likelihood of a data point being missing is unrelated to any observed or unobserved variables. MCAR is considered a desirable type of missing data because it does not introduce bias into the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Missing at Random (MAR):** Missing data is considered MAR when the probability of data being missing depends on other observed variables but not on the missing data itself. This type can still lead to unbiased results if the observed variables related to missingness are included in the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Missing Not at Random (MNAR):** In MNAR, the probability of data being missing is related to the missing data itself. MNAR can introduce bias into the analysis as the missing values may be systematically different from the observed data."

    "### Decision Tree Imputation\n",
    "\n",
    "Imputing missing data is a crucial step in data preprocessing. It helps ensure that the dataset is complete and ready for machine learning modeling. Various imputation techniques are available, and the choice of technique depends on the nature of the data and the type of missing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "One imputation method that we applied to the heart disease dataset is decision tree imputation. Decision tree imputation involves using a decision tree model to predict and fill in missing values based on other observed variables. This technique offers several advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Non-linearity:** Decision trees can capture complex, non-linear relationships in the data. They are well-suited for handling non-linear relationships between variables, which is common in real-world datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Handling Categorical Data:** Decision trees can naturally handle both categorical and numerical data, making them suitable for datasets with a mix of variable types.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Variable Importance:** Decision tree models can provide insights into the importance of each feature for imputing missing values. This information can be valuable for understanding which variables play a key role in imputation.\n",
    "Robustness to Outliers: Decision trees are robust to outliers in the data, making them a suitable choice when missing data is related to outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "By utilizing decision tree imputation, we aim to fill in missing values in a way that preserves the underlying relationships within the data, thereby improving the quality of the dataset and enhancing the performance of machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of imputation technique should be driven by the nature of the data and the specific objectives of the analysis. In our case, decision tree imputation was selected due to its ability to capture non-linear relationships and handle both categorical and numerical data effectively."
